This is my first attempt at creating an Open World, RPG game in Unity. This is currently a WIP, and there will hopefully be a built version released soon!

## Installation and Running
I will soon put out a build for the chess game, but before that, you can download the source code and import the project using the Unity Hub with version [2022](https://unity.com/releases/2022-lts). You can then run this the same as any Unity project.
